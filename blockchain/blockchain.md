# Blockchain Smart Contracts & Deployment Scripts

## Coming Soon!

We are working on adding example smart contracts and deployment scripts for:

### Smart Contracts

- **Authentication Contract** - Confidential password storage on Oasis Sapphire
- **ENS Registry** - User identity management (compatible with any ENS network)
- **Resolver Contracts** - Address resolution for ENS names

### Deployment Scripts

- Hardhat deployment scripts
- Contract verification examples
- Network configuration examples (Oasis Sapphire, Hoodi, etc.)
- Initial setup and funding instructions

## Current Demo Contracts

For now, you can interact with our demo contracts:

- **Authentication Contract** (Oasis Sapphire Testnet): `0xf4B4d8b8a9b1F104b2100F6d68e1ab21C3a2DF76`
- **ENS Registry** (Hoodi): `0x5841d17010252BE760D055cba2f2853874457443`

## Stay Tuned

We'll be adding comprehensive examples and documentation for deploying your own blockchain-based SIP authentication infrastructure soon!
